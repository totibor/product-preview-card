## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The `srcset` attribute in the `<img>` tag complements the `src` attribute instead of replacing it. You still need to have a valid `src` attribute.

### Continued development

### Useful resources
