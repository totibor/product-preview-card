## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

<img src="./result.png" width="800">

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The `srcset` attribute in the `<img>` tag complements the `src` attribute instead of replacing it. You still need to have a valid `src` attribute.

### Continued development

Better understand the `<picture>` and `<img>` tags:

[Responsive images](https://web.dev/learn/design/responsive-images)

[The picture element](https://web.dev/learn/design/picture-element)

### Useful resources

[max-inline-size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/max-inline-size)

[block-size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/block-size) - Value of `auto` means the browser preserves your images' aspect ratio as it resizes them.

[object-position](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-position) - Adjust the focus of the crop.
